Telegram to convert any given LaTeX code in a Telegram Chat into a rendered picture for easy viewing

Expanded on the original called LatexBot. Unfortunately, the dependencies were all outdated and it didn't work anymore.

`\convert` converts any LaTeX code in a math environment

`\convertraw` converts any (multiline) LaTeX code in a normal LaTeX environment. Math mode has to be manually enabled with `$`s or a suitable environment. No adding of preamble packages are allowed.
